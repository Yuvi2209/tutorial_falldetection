The discussion and results section of research on fall risk detection in the geriatric population provides a comprehensive analysis of study findings, 
interpretation of results, comparison with existing literature, implications for practice and policy, and avenues for future research.
To evaluate various trained models and to compute efficiency of various algorithms on the basis of parameter such as accuracy, specificity, sensitivity.
Accuracy is the ratio of predictions that our model got right which is being calculated by using average of sensitivity and specificity.
The performance of SVM is found to be best out of other algorithms for the considered data. SVM performs well form other algorithms, 
even when you are dealing with data that has many features. 
As we as, SVM can achieve good performance even with relatively small datasets.
